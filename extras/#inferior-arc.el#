;;; CHANGE LOG
;;; ===========================================================================
;;; 8/88 Olin
;;; Created.
;;;
;;; 2/15/89 Olin
;;; Removed -emacs flag from process invocation. It's only useful for
;;; cscheme, and makes cscheme assume it's running under xscheme.el,
;;; which messes things up royally. A bug.
;;;
;;; 5/22/90 Olin
;;; - Upgraded to use comint-send-string and comint-send-region.
;;; - run-scheme now offers to let you edit the command line if
;;;   you invoke it with a prefix-arg. m-x scheme is redundant, and
;;;   has been removed.
;;; - explicit references to process "scheme" have been replaced with
;;;   (scheme-proc). this allows better handling of multiple process bufs.
;;; - added scheme-send-last-sexp, bound to c-x c-e. a gnu convention.
;;; - have not added process query facility a la cmulisp.el's lisp-show-arglist
;;;   and friends, but interested hackers might find a useful application
;;;   of this facility.
;;;
;;; 3/12/90 olin
;;; - scheme-load-file and scheme-compile-file no longer switch-to-scheme.
;;;   tale suggested this.
;;;
;;; 2/08/08 sjs
;;; - adapted for arc (basically s/scheme/arc/g)

an arc process can be fired up with m-x run-arc.

customization: entry to this mode runs the hooks on comint-mode-hook and
inferior-arc-mode-hook (in that order).

you can send text to the inferior arc process from other buffers containing
arc source.
    switch-to-arc switches the current buffer to the arc process buffer.
    arc-send-definition sends the current definition to the arc process.
    arc-send-region sends the current region to the arc process.

        switch to the arc process buffer after sending their text.
for information on running multiple processes in multiple buffers, see
documentation for variable arc-buffer.

commands:
return after the end of the process' output sends the text from the
    end of process to point.
return before the end of the process' output copies the sexp ending at point
    to the end of the process' output, and sends it.
delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.
tab indents for arc; with argument, shifts rest
    of expression rigidly with the current line.
c-m-q does tab on each line starting within following expression.
paragraphs are separated only by blank lines.  semicolons start comments.
if you accidentally suspend your process, use \\[comint-continue-subjob]

multiple process support
===========================================================================
inferior-arc.el supports, in a fairly simple fashion, running multiple arc
processes.  to run multiple arc processes, you start the first up with
\\[run-arc].  it will be in a buffer named *arc*.  rename this buffer
with \\[rename-buffer].  you may now start up a new process with another
\\[run-arc].  it will be in a new buffer, named *arc*.  you can
switch between the different process buffers with \\[switch-to-buffer].

commands that send text from source buffers to arc processes -- like
`arc-send-definition' -- have to choose a process to send to, when you
have more than one arc process around.  this is determined by the
global variable `arc-buffer'.  suppose you have three inferior arcs
running:
    buffer      process
    foo         arc
    bar         arc<2>
    *arc*    arc<3>
if you do a \\[arc-send-definition-and-go] command on some arc source
code, what process do you send it to?

- if you're in a process buffer (foo, bar, or *arc*),
  you send it to that process.
- if you're in some other buffer (e.g., a source file), you
  send it to the process attached to buffer `arc-buffer'.
this process selection is performed by function `arc-proc'.

whenever \\[run-arc] fires up a new process, it resets `arc-buffer'
to be the new process's buffer.  if you only run one process, this will
do the right thing.  if you run multiple processes, you can change
`arc-buffer' to another process buffer with \\[set-variable].

more sophisticated approaches are, of course, possible.  if you find yourself
needing to switch back and forth between multiple processes frequently,
you may wish to consider ilisp.el, a larger, more sophisticated package
for running inferior lisp and arc processes.  the approach taken here is
for a minimal, simple implementation.  feel free to extend it.")
