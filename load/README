.arc files in this directory (load/) will be autoloaded by libs.arc, after the
usual arc files (strings.arc, srv.arc, etc). See CHANGES/autoload for details.

Code should go here only if it is either:

1. An important language extension (eg 'make-br-fn), especially one which a
   library writer would find obnoxious or undesirable to have to 'load manually.

2. Features important for, and preferably specific to, the REPL. For example, an
   interactive help subsystem.

This is emphatically NOT the place to put libraries. No, we don't care how shiny
it is. Put it in lib/ where it belongs.
